Hello there!

Thank you for your interest in my first back-end project.

To get started and run the project locally, you will need to set up environment variables. Please follow these steps:

1. **Create environment files**: create two `.env` files for your project, one named `.env.test` and another named `.env.development`
2. **Configure databases**: into each file, add `PGDATABASE=` followed by the correct database name for that environment (please see `/db/setup.sql` for the correct database names)
3. **Proceed with setup**: you're now ready to proceed with setting up and running the project!
