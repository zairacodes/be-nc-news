# Northcoders News API

Hello there!

Thank you for your interest in my first back-end project.

You can explore the hosted version of the API [here](https://be-nc-news-6djf.onrender.com/api/).  
Please note that since this project is on a free plan, there may be delays of 50 seconds or more due to inactivity causing the server to spin down. Thanks for your patience.

## Overview

The Northcoders News API serves as a platform for accessing and interacting with various articles, topics, comments and users, aiming to mimic a real-world backend service like [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/).  
This API serves as the backend for the NC News application, handling all server-side logic and database management. You can explore the front-end project [here](https://github.com/zairacodes/nc-news/) and the deployed app [here](https://ncnews-zaira.netlify.app/).

## Tech Stack

- **Testing**: Jest, Supertest (TDD)
- **Backend**: Express
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Hosting**: Supabase (DB), Render (API)
